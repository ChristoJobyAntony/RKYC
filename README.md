We propose a method of implementing KYC remotely using identity verification with voice and face biometrics.

We use a combination of OTP and a confidence score generated using face and voice verification to establish user verification. This is advantageous as it allows the end-user to perform KYC remotely from any location.

In addition, this program allows for general purpose verfication of identity without access to specialised equipment for fingerprint or iris biometrics.

For installation, refer to `BUILDING.md`
