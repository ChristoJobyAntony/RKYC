# Remote KYC

We propose a method of implementing KYC remotely using identity verification with voice and face biometrics.

We use a combination of OTP and a confidence score generated using face and voice verification to establish user verification. This is advantageous as it allows the end-user to perform KYC remotely from any location.

In addition, this program allows for general purpose verfication of identity without access to specialised equipment for fingerprint or iris biometrics.
